The Brandenburg Concertos by Johann Sebastian Bach (BWV 1046–1051, original title: Six Concerts à plusieurs instruments) are a collection of six instrumental works presented by Bach to Christian Ludwig, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt,in 1721 (though probably composed earlier). They are widely regarded as some of the best orchestral compositions of the Baroque era.
